# Hack-The-Box
Just notes on the boxes I've done in preparation for OSCP from TjNull's list (retired boxes only)

Right now I've just done a quick cleaning to make it more readable in Github as my notes are in Obsidian and there was some formatting issues as well as image upload issues I need to fix. The notes however are all you need as I have also pasted the output for everything in text too.

There were about 42 boxes on the list, 4 Active ( 2 linux, 1 windows and 1 AD) which I didn't include here.

Note: For Busqueda, Keeper and Soccer my notes are minimal as those were my first 3 boxes. I will update it with better notes once I redo those labs.
