# Hack-The-Box

Sharing my personal notes from the retired Hack The Box machines I’ve completed from TJNull’s OSCP prep list — in case they’re helpful to others on the same path!



These notes reflect:

 ▶️ My own methodology and thought process

 ▶️ Key takeaways from various walkthroughs and guides I studied

 ▶️ A focus on learning why something works, not just how



I’ve done some basic cleanup to make the notes readable on GitHub (since they were originally in Obsidian). I’ll continue refining them over time, but for now, they should be clear enough to follow my approach and procedure.



Feel free to use them as a reference or starting point. Hope it helps someone out there grinding toward OSCP+!

There were about 42 boxes on the list, 4 Active ( 2 linux, 1 windows and 1 AD) which I didn't include here.

Note: For Busqueda, Keeper and Soccer my notes are minimal as those were my first 3 boxes. I will update it with better notes once I redo those labs.
